# Node.js Template

This is a template for creating a new project with Node.js.

This template is configured to work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) framework.

To help with code padronization it's already configured with [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (using Airbnb style guide) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

It's ready to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)'s debug too.
